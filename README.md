<p>Create Spotify playlists based on Billboard Hot 100 charts for any given date.</p><br>

<h2>Introduction<a name="introduction_h"></a></h2>
<p>This project aims to automate the creation of Spotify playlists based on Billboard's Hot 100 chart for a specified date. It is designed for music enthusiasts who want to revisit popular music from a specific time period. The script fetches song data from the Billboard Hot 100 and then searches for these tracks on Spotify, creating a nostalgic playlist for the user.</p><br>

<h2>Functionality<a name="functionality_h"></a></h2>
<p>The program works by first asking the user for a target date. It then scrapes the Billboard Hot 100 chart for that date to get the list of top songs. Using Spotify's API, it searches for these songs and creates a new Spotify playlist, adding the found tracks to this playlist. The script also handles various edge cases and errors, such as invalid date formats and missing songs on Spotify.</p><br>
